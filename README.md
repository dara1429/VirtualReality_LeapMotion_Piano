# VR/Leap Motion Piano Readme #

Summary :
- This application provides the ability for a user to play a virtual piano (with VR), while using fully mapped hands (via Leap Motion). This allows for more accurate, real-to-life playing of a piano. 
- The user can choose to play on the virtual piano freely, highlighting his/her keystrokes, or practice by following a series of keystrokes read in by a sample song file.

- Note : Unity was used for version control as only one of the groups computers could run/test the Oculus software reliably. Thus, changes were all sent and tested to one computer and commits were only made from that computer.
